For some of them, you'll need a working permit from the *Immigration Agency*, for others, you don't. Especially for internships where you are payed the minimum wage, the *Immigration Agency* will also contact the *Employment Agency* whether you are eligible for the specific employment. So, in order to get an adequate explanation of what you are allowed to do and what not, you best get in contact with your *Immigration Agency*.\r\n\r\n**In general, you are not allowed to take up an occupation earlier than 3 months after you applied for asylum! This also applies if you are forced to stay within an refugee center, for example, if you are coming from a safe country.** \r\n\r\nHowever, a so called *Hospitation* where you get insight into a company or working place without actively participating and without getting any wage is usually not defined as occupation. So this might be something you could even do before the three-month-timeline if you find an opportunity where you can be an observer for some days.\r\n\r\nFor all other kinds of internship, you must fulfil the prerequsites and you need a permit from the *Immigration Agency*. If you have been **granted asylum, the status as refugee or subsidiary protection**, you are eligible for a **recidency permit** that gives you unlimited access to the German labour market.\r\n\r\n**Internships with a duration over 3 months** have to be payed with the official minimum wage and you'll also need a permit of the *Employment Agency* which needs additional prerequisites to be granted.\r\n\r\nIf you want to do an **internship for orientation prior to starting an apprenticeship**, you don't need a permit of the Employment Agency but only from the *Immigration Agency*. Same accounts for internships where your potential **future employer wants to check whether you are a generally suitable for the selected branch**, called *Eignungsfeststellungs*.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you have to do work which is typically done by a normal employee during your internship, this is rather **regarded as trial working** and also needs a permit from the *Employment Agency*.\r\n\r\nAs you see, the exact classification of your internship might be difficult and has several consequences, so professional counselling by your Immigration or Emloyment Agency is very advisable if you want to do an internship.\r\n\r\nShorty, the permit from the *Immigration Agency* is usually granted if you fulfil the prerequisites while the permit from the *Employment Agency* is a more complex process also involving your future employer and the local labour situation in your branch."
