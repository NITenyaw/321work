Depending on your field of work, it is possible that your customers won't be able to talk to you in English in a convenient way. Thus, it's usually very hard to find a job if your German language skills are not good enough for simple conversation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, you'll considerably improve your chances of finding employment or to starting an apprenticeship if you have no serious problems communicating in German. Then you also maximise the benefit of exercising your foreign language skills everyday. \r\n\r\nYou should inform yourself what level of German is usually excepted for applicants in the sector you would like to work. Your local employment agency is the best spot where you can find this information. You can also find information about language courses there."

		  "description": "Different kinds of internships\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nGerman law differentiates several kinds of internship. For some of them, you'll need a working permit from the *Immigration Agency*, for others, you don't. Especially for internships where you are paid the minimum wage, the *Immigration Agency* will also contact the *Employment Agency* whether you are eligible for the specific employment opportunity. So, in order to get an adequate explanation of what you are allowed to do and what not, you'd best get in contact with your *Immigration Agency*.\r\n\r\n**In general, you are not allowed to take up an occupation earlier than 3 months after you've applied for asylum! This also applies if you are forced to stay within a refugee center, for example, if you are coming from a safe country.** \r\n\r\nHowever, a so called *Hospitation* where you get insight into a company or working place without actively participating and without getting any payment is usually not defined as an occupation. So this might be something you could even do before the three-month-timeline if you find an opportunity where you can be an observer for some days.\r\n\r\nFor all other kinds of internships, you must fulfil the prerequsites and you need a permit from the *Immigration Agency*. If you have been **granted asylum, the status as refugee or subsidiary protection**, you are eligible for a **residency permit** that gives you unlimited access to the German labour market.\r\n\r\n**Internships with a duration of over 3 months** have to be payed with the official minimum wage and you'll also need a permit from the *Employment Agency* which needs additional prerequisites to be granted.\r\n\r\nIf you want to do an **internship for orientation prior to starting an apprenticeship**, you don't need a permit from the Employment Agency but only from the *Immigration Agency*. the same goes for internships where your potential **future employer wants to check whether you are generally suited to the selected branch**, called *Eignungsfeststellungs*.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you have to do work which is typically done by a normal employee during your internship, this is rather **regarded as trial working** and also needs a permit from the *Employment Agency*.\r\n\r\nAs you see, the exact classification of your internship might be difficult and has several consequences, so professional counselling by your Immigration or Emloyment Agency is very advisable if you want to do an internship.\r\n\r\nShorty, the permit from the *Immigration Agency* is usually granted if you fulfil the prerequisites while the permit from the *Employment Agency* is a more complex process also involving your future employer and the local labour situation in your branch."
